# Volcano Inventory
A quick python script for querying the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program volcanic eruption database (https://volcano.si.edu/gvp_votw.cfm).

This script takes advantage of the WFS capabilities of the GeoServer; making GET requests to the database and doing some minimal processing on the data that it gets in GeoJSON format.
